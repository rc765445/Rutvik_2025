#### Hi, my name is Rutvik Chavda. I am a Sophomore and I am 15 years old. My favorite food is Pizza because I love the taste of cheese and sauce combined. My favorite resturant is Taco Bell and I eat there almost every 2 weeks. I play basketball and like to go to the gym during the weekends. Im about to go for basketball practice on September 11th at Sol. I like to play video games and I have a Ps5. My family is my parents, grandparents, and my little sister. We always go on walks and love to spend time with each other. I am Indian and both my parents are 100% Indian. I am Hindu and love to celebrate my heritage and culture. I love to hangout my friends on Friday. We usually go to the movies or go to some resturant. I am also part of an organization named BAPS which primarly made for Hindus for worship. I go to BAPS every Sunday and I meet a lot of my friends through there. I love to go on walks and enjoy watching nature. On the weekends I go on a walk at 11 or 12. ðŸ˜€
