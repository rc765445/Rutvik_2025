#### Hi, my name is Rutvik Chavda. I am a Sophomore and I am 15 years old. My favorite food is Pizza because I love the taste of cheese and sauce combined. My favorite resturant is Taco Bell and I eat there almost every 2 weeks. I play basketball and like to go to the gym during the weekends. I like to play video games and I have a Ps5. My family is my parents, grandparents, and my little sister. We always go on walks and love to spend time with each other
