  <p2 style="font-size:100%; color: green; font: italic bold 15px Arial, sans-serif;">  Week 0-1:  This week we learned on setup and tools. At first we had to download homebrew, VS CODE, and Github. Then we went over to Mr Mortensens room and we got our tools set up by the CSA kids. At first I didnt know what they were doing. However, after reading what is on github I figured that they were git cloning my repository and install tools such as ruby. Then we learned the first we steps for building our website.  </p2>

  Week 2: This week we actually started on working on website and group project. At first me and my partner wanted to do a cookie clicker game but we soon realized how complicated that would be. Then we decided on making a blog based on Indian Culture since its simple and we are both Indian. Then I made two other blogs one about the history of Nintendo and a self improvement guide. Then I learned what a sprite sheet is and how we needed that to code Mario. After I finished Mario we customized our home page with our name, buttons, and a photo. Then after I edited everything and made sure everything was fine. </p2>
