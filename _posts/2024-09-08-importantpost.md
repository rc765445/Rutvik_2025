It consists of many different religions, languages, and values that are very different from each other.  India has 2 main areas including North and South India which are very different from each other. North India has many languages but most of the people speak Gujarati, Hindi, and Punjabi. Meanwhile South India's main languages are Tamil and Telugu. These two areas also have very different types of food. North India has foods like Paneer, Rotli Shak, etc. South India has different food like Idli Sambhar, Dosa, and Uttapam. Although these two regions are different they do have many similarities. They both share a similar religion and festivals. The majority of Indians in the North and South are Hindu and many of them believe in the same gods. A place of worship for most Indians are temples called mandirs. Many of the gods in Hinduism are reincartions of 3 main gods named: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu.
